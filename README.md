# SPA - React product List

This project was created for my Single Page Application class. It shows how you can fetch and display API data from the client side in React. There currently is no backend, but the API call to the OpenWeather API should be moved there.

To use, update the `key` variable in `src/components/Weather.tsx` with an OpenWeatherMap API ket. You can get that.[here](https://openweathermap.org/appid).

## Available Scripts

### `HTTPS=true npm run start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [https://localhost:3000](https://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### `npm run eject`

If you arenâ€™t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them.
